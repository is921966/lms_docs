## [1.8.4] - 2025-07-01

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Clarified time tracking terminology
  - –£—Å–ª–æ–≤–Ω—ã–µ –¥–Ω–∏ (conditional days) - internal project numbering (Day 1, 2, 3, ..., 101, 102...)
  - –ö–∞–ª–µ–Ω–¥–∞—Ä–Ω—ã–µ –¥–Ω–∏ (calendar days) - actual days from project start June 21, 2025
  - Clarified that there is NO mathematical relationship between these two systems
  - Calendar days must be calculated programmatically

### Changed
- Updated `.cursorrules` with correct time calculation system
