echo "📊 Build History Summary:"
echo "  - Version 1.0 has multiple expired builds (202507xxxxxx format)"
echo "  - Latest active builds: 96, 99, 88"
echo "  - All using date-based numbering (problematic)"

echo "✅ New Numbering System:"
echo "  - Simple incremental numbers (101, 102, 103...)"
echo "  - Easier to track and manage"
echo "  - No more confusing date stamps"

echo "🎯 Recommendations:"
echo "1. Use ./auto-testflight.sh for automated builds"
echo "2. Use ./build-testflight-manual.sh for manual builds"
echo "3. Both scripts now use incremental numbering"

echo "📝 To manually adjust build number:"
echo "  ./scripts/get-next-build-number.sh set <number>"
