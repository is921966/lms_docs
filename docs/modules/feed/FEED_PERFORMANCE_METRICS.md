## Performance Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Lazy Loading
```swift
LazyVStack {
    ForEach(posts) { post in
        FeedPostCard(post: post)
            .onAppear {
                prefetchImagesForPost(post)
            }
    }
}
```

### 2. Image Optimization

- WebP format support
- Thumbnail pre-generation
- Adaptive quality based on network

### 3. Caching Strategy
- In-memory cache for recent posts
- Disk cache for images
