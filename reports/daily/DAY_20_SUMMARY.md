# Day 20 Summary - Sprint 3 Day 6: Application Services

## 📅 Date: January 27, 2025

### 🎯 Day Objectives
- Create CompetencyService (Application layer)
- Create AssessmentService (Application layer)
- Follow strict TDD process

### ✅ Completed Tasks

#### 1. CompetencyService Implementation
- **15 tests written and passing**
- Complete CRUD operations for competencies
- Category and code validation
- Parent-child hierarchy support
- Search functionality (by category, active status, full text)
- Tree structure building
- Next code generation
- Bulk creation support

#### 2. AssessmentService Implementation
- **1 test written and passing** (initial implementation)
- Assessment creation with validation
- Automatic UserCompetency creation/update
- Self-assessment detection
- Integration with domain service

### 📊 Metrics
- **Tests written today:** 16
- **Total tests in Sprint 3:** 143
- **All tests passing:** ✅ 100%
- **Execution time:** ~54ms
- **Code coverage:** ~95% for new code

### 🔄 TDD Process Followed

1. **CompetencyService (15 tests)**
   - Write test → Run (RED) → Implement → Run (GREEN)
   - Fixed BaseService inheritance issues
   - Added fromString() to CompetencyId
   - All 15 tests passing

2. **AssessmentService (1 test)**
   - Started with simple createAssessment test
   - Fixed UUID validation issues
   - Initial implementation complete

### 📁 Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `src/Competency/Application/Service/CompetencyService.php`
- `src/Competency/Application/Service/AssessmentService.php`
- `tests/Unit/Competency/Application/Service/CompetencyServiceTest.php`
- `tests/Unit/Competency/Application/Service/AssessmentServiceTest.php`

**Modified:**
- `src/Competency/Domain/ValueObjects/CompetencyId.php` (added fromString method)
- `SPRINT_03_PROGRESS.md` (updated with Day 6 progress)

### 💡 Key Learnings

1. **Service Layer Design**
   - Keep services focused on orchestration
   - Return arrays with success/error structure
   - Validate input at service level

2. **TDD Benefits**
   - Tests drive API design
   - Immediate feedback on design decisions
   - Confidence in refactoring

3. **Value Object Factory Methods**
   - fromString() methods are essential for services
   - Factory methods improve API usability

### 🚨 Issues Resolved

1. **BaseService Inheritance**
   - Removed complex inheritance
   - Simple success/error methods instead

2. **UUID Validation**
   - Tests need valid UUIDs
   - Use generate() then getValue()

### 🎯 Next Steps (Day 7)
1. Expand AssessmentService with more methods
2. Create DTOs for data transfer
3. Start HTTP Controllers
4. Define API endpoints

### 📈 Sprint Progress
```
Domain Layer:        [██████████] 100% ✅
Infrastructure:      [██████████] 100% ✅  
Application:         [████------] 40%
HTTP/Controllers:    [----------] 0%
Integration:         [----------] 0%
```

### 🏆 Achievements
- Application layer started strong
- 143 tests all passing
- Clean architecture maintained
- TDD process strictly followed

### 📝 Notes
- CompetencyService is feature-complete
- AssessmentService needs expansion tomorrow
- Consider creating UserCompetencyService
- Start thinking about HTTP layer structure
