2. **Created missing tests**:
   - FeedComment tests (~30)
   - FeedAttachment tests (~30)
   - FeedPermissions tests (~20)
3. **Extended FeedService tests** to 30+ tests
4. **Created UI tests**:
   - FeedViewUITests (~20)
   - FeedPostCardUITests (~20)
   - CreatePostViewUITests (~25)
   - CommentsViewUITests (~25)

2. ✅ UserResponse constructor mismatch - created TestUserResponseFactory
3. ✅ FeedPost initialization issues - fixed structure
4. ✅ Async/await errors in tests - added try statements
5. ⚠️ Compilation errors in other modules blocking test execution

### 🚧 Remaining Tasks:
1. ❌ Run all tests and achieve 100% pass rate
2. ❌ Measure and improve code coverage
3. ❌ Create documentation
4. ❌ Prepare TestFlight release

### 📈 Sprint Completion: ~90%

### ⏱️ Time Spent: ~4 hours

### 🔄 Next Steps:
1. Focus on fixing compilation issues in other modules
2. Run all Feed module tests
3. Fix any failing tests
4. Create comprehensive documentation
5. Prepare TestFlight build
